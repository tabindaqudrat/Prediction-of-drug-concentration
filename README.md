# Prediction-of-drug-concentration
The primary goal of the notebook is to predict drug concentration levels at different time points based on patient covariates using machine learning models such as:  Random Forest Regressor Gradient Boosting Regressor Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet regressions Neural Networks.
